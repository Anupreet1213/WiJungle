# WiJungle Internship Assignment

## Important Note

## Deployment Issue

- The deployed version of the project is hosted on a server with HTTPS enabled.
- **Important:** The GeoLocation API does not support HTTPS servers, resulting in API calls failing when the project is accessed via the deployed HTTPS link.
- To experience the full functionality of the project, it is recommended to run the application locally.
- Unfortunately, this issue got detected after the deployment and due to time restrictions, I was not able to find a suitable replacement for the same api.

## Local Environment

- The project is fully functional when run on a local environment.
- All API calls to the WiJungle service work as expected when the application is executed locally.
